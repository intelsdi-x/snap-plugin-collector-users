# snap collector plugin - users

This plugin has ability to gather the number of logged-in users. Though this type of information can be obtained from various files in the Linux system but in this plugin there is a command line utility 'who' to get the list of user logged in the system.
															
The plugin is used in the [snap framework] (http://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap).

## Getting Started

### System Requirements
* Linux system with available `who` tool at `/usr/bin/who`
 
### Operating systems
All OSs currently supported by snap:
* Linux/amd64

### Installation

#### Download the plugin binary:
You can get the pre-built binaries for your OS and architecture at plugins's [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-collector-users/releases) page. Download the plugins package from the latest release, unzip and store in a path you want `snaptel` to access.

#### To build the plugin binary:
Fork https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-collector-users

Clone repo into `$GOPATH/src/github.com/intelsdi-x/`:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/<yourGithubID>/snap-plugin-collector-users.git
```

Build the snap users plugin by running make within the cloned repo:
```
$ make
```
This builds the plugin in `./build/`

### Configuration and Usage

* Set up the [snap framework](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/blob/master/README.md#getting-started)
* Load the plugin and create a task, see example in [Examples](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-collector-users/blob/master/README.md#examples).

## Documentation

### Collected Metrics
This plugin has the ability to gather the following metrics:

Metric Namespace | Data Type | Description
------------ | ------------- | -------------
/intel/utmp/users/logged | uint64 | A number of users logged-in
/intel/utmp/users/logged_min | uint64 | A minimum number of logged-in users<sup>(*)</sup>
/intel/utmp/users/logged_max | uint64 | A maximum number of logged-in users<sup>(*)</sup>
/intel/utmp/users/logged_avg | float64 | An average number of logged-in users<sup>(*)</sup>

<sup>(*)</sup> since the task was started																																					
By default metrics are gathered once per second.

### Examples

Example of running snap users collector and writing data to file.

Ensure [snap daemon is running](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap#running-snap):
* initd: `sudo service snap-telemetry start`
* systemd: `sudo systemctl start snap-telemetry`
* command line: `sudo snapteld -l 1 -t 0 &`

Download and load snap plugins:
```
$ wget http://snap.ci.snap-telemetry.io/plugins/snap-plugin-collector-users/latest/linux/x86_64/snap-plugin-collector-users
$ wget http://snap.ci.snap-telemetry.io/plugins/snap-plugin-publisher-file/latest/linux/x86_64/snap-plugin-publisher-file
$ snaptel plugin load snap-plugin-collector-users
$ snaptel plugin load snap-plugin-publisher-file
```

See available metrics for your system
```
$ snaptel metric list
```

Create a task manifest file to use snap-plugin-collector-users plugin (exemplary file in [examples/tasks/] (https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-collector-users/blob/master/examples/tasks/)):
```json
{
    "version": 1,
    "schedule": {
        "type": "simple",
        "interval": "1s"
    },
    "workflow": {
        "collect": {
            "metrics": {
                "/intel/utmp/users/logged": {},
                "/intel/utmp/users/logged_avg": {},
                "/intel/utmp/users/logged_max": {},
                "/intel/utmp/users/logged_min": {}
            },
            "config": {
            },
            "process": null,
            "publish": [
                {
                    "plugin_name": "file",
                    "config": {
                        "file": "/tmp/published_users"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
    
```

Create a task:
```
$ snaptel task create -t users-file.json
Using task manifest to create task
Task created
ID: b0ba4a9c-9011-4117-bd25-803b732f8e5b
Name: Task-b0ba4a9c-9011-4117-bd25-803b732f8e5b
State: Running
```
See sample output from `snaptel task watch <task_id>`

```
$ snaptel task watch  b0ba4a9c-9011-4117-bd25-803b732f8e5b

```
(Keys `ctrl+c` terminate task watcher)


These data are published to file and stored there (in this example in /tmp/published_users).

Stop previously created task:
```
$ snaptel task stop b0ba4a9c-9011-4117-bd25-803b732f8e5b
Task stopped:
ID: b0ba4a9c-9011-4117-bd25-803b732f8e5b
```
